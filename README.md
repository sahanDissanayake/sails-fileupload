How I envision this app to work

1. User will upload the the images using the homepage
2. Then the images will be uploaded to to the assets/useruplods folder

3. As soon as the upload is done Grunt will inject these files to the .tmp/ folder so that it is publicly available.


The problem right now is, I cannot get this to work. Any cotntributions welcome.
